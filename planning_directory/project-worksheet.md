# Project Overview

## Project Description

For Project Four of the General Assembly SEI course, I was assigned to create a mobile first web application that shows my knowledge and understanding of CRUD and RESTful APIs. The requirements for this project consisted of using Python and Django in the backend, and using HTML, CSS, and Django in the frontend. The backend is deployed via Heroku, while the frontend is deployed via Netlify.

For this project, I will be building a task management application. The purpose of this task management application is to allow users to efficiently organize their everyday life, and making sure they keep up to date with any tasks they are want or need to accomplish. Users must sign up for an account and only then will they be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks of their choosing.

## User Stories

- Users can register for an account
- Users can log into their account
- Users can create a task
- Users can edit task description and due dates
- Users can check off tasks
- Users can delete tasks
- Users can create items within the task
- Users can edit and delete items within the task

## Code Snippet

```
def get_queryset(self):
        try:
            if self.kwargs.get("task_pk") and self.kwargs.get("pk"):
                task = Task.objects.get(pk=self.kwargs["task_pk"])
                queryset = Item.objects.filter(
                    task=task,
                    user=self.request.user,
                    pk=self.kwargs["pk"]
                )
                return queryset
        except Task.DoesNotExist:
            raise ValidationError("You cannot access a item that doesn't exist")
```

I thought the try and except was very useful to grab a error message that was not generated by the view class that was used. It was customized so that we could check for it in the frontend and work off of that.

## Issues and Resolutions

```
ISSUE: During Heroku authorization migration: 
You are trying to change the nullable field 'first_name' on user to non-nullable without a default; we can't do that (the database needs something to populate existing rows).
RESOLUTION: Had to add back null=True to first_name and last_name User model

ISSUE: item did not pop up in the task when defining a singular variable in serializer 
RESOLUTION: pluralizing item because it is many=True for serializing
```
