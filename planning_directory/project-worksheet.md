# Project Overview

## Project Description

For Project Four of the General Assembly SEI course, I was assigned to create a mobile first web application that shows my knowledge and understanding of CRUD and RESTful APIs. The requirements for this project consisted of using Python and Django in the backend, and using HTML, CSS, and Django in the frontend. The backend is deployed via Heroku, while the frontend is deployed via Netlify.

For this project, I will be building a task management application. The purpose of this task management application is to allow users to efficiently organize their everyday life, and making sure they keep up to date with any tasks they are want or need to accomplish. Users must sign up for an account and only then will they be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks of their choosing.

## User Stories

- Users can register for an account
- Users can log into their account
- Users can create a task
- Users can edit tasks
- Users can also cross off tasks
- Users can delete tasks
